I am Han from China. Now I am studying & working in Stuttgart, Germany for my master thesis. My major area is about embedded software developing. During the spare time, I also do programming in other fields e.g. Android, django etc.

I like swimming, cycling. I took the half Marathon last few weeks and later I plan to try the triathlon.
